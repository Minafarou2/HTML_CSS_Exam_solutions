        Both <input type="submit" value="click me"> and <button type="submit">Click me</button> can be used to create a button that triggers form submission, but they have some differences in terms of customization and behavior:

        Markup and Syntax:

        <input type="submit" value="click me">: This is an input element of type "submit." It uses the value attribute to set the text displayed on the button.
         The button text is directly specified within the value attribute.
        <button type="submit">Click me</button>: This is a button element of type "submit." The button text is placed between the opening and closing <button> tags, 
        providing more flexibility for including rich content like images, icons, or other HTML elements.
